Scenario 1: Attempting to Enter the Guild
The player starts at the Dungeon Entrance, which contains exits to the north (leading to the First Layer) and to the east (leading to the Guild).
A Billboard is in the room. When the player uses the EXAMINE command on it, they receive a message warning about dungeon dangers and stating that entry to the Guild requires a Necklace.

The player tries to move east using the E command.
They are blocked by a Gatekeeper, implemented as a Puzzle named Nobleman’s Commission.
The puzzle requires the player to have the Necklace item in their inventory to proceed.
Since the Necklace is not in the player’s inventory, the puzzle cannot be solved, and the player is not allowed to enter the Guild.
The player must explore elsewhere to find the required item.

Scenario 2: Solving Puzzle and Entering the Guild
The player moves north into the Second Layer, then east into the First Layer.
In the First Layer, they encounter a Broken Staircase, which blocks further movement.
The Broken Staircase is implemented as a Puzzle (or Fixture associated with a Puzzle).

The player uses a Repair Tool item from their inventory.
The solve() method is triggered, and the game checks that the item matches the puzzle’s solution and has remaining uses.
The puzzle is solved, the staircase is repaired, and new exits are unlocked.

The player then moves south back to the Dungeon Entrance.
This time, the player has obtained the Necklace item.
They attempt to enter the Guild again using the E command.

The Nobleman’s Commission puzzle checks for the Necklace and is successfully solved.
The Gatekeeper allows entry.
Inside the Guild, the player meets the Guildmaster, who gives them a Gold Coin item as a reward.
